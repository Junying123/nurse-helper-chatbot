The EAPC working group identified four general approaches to consider when encountering adverse effects caused by opioids: dose reduction of systemic opioid, symptomatic management of the adverse effect, opioid rotation, and switching the route of systemic administration.3\\nIf pain is well controlled, small reductions in the dose of opioid may help resolve the adverse effect while maintaining pain control.3'},\n",
